# Oculith Draw Foundation documentation

Oculith Draw Foundation is a free, open-source desktop app for reviewing construction drawings. Open PDF sheets, mark them up, measure them and compare revisions, on your own machine. It is licensed under the LGPL-3.0 and needs no account and no network connection.

Oculith Draw Foundation is made by [Oculith](https://oculith.io). The source is at [github.com/GhostTekz/oculith-foundation](https://github.com/GhostTekz/oculith-foundation).

## Start here

1. Read the first sections of the [user guide](GUIDE.md): the window, opening documents, and the markup tools.
2. Set a scale and measure a sheet: [Measuring](GUIDE.md#measuring).
3. Save reusable tools in the [Tool Chest](GUIDE.md#tool-chest), and review your work in the [Markups List](GUIDE.md#markups-list).
4. To build the app yourself, follow [Building from source](BUILDING.md).
5. To work on the code, read the [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md), [add-on interface](ADDONS.md), and [file format](FILE-FORMAT.md).

## Documents

### [User guide](GUIDE.md)

The full guide to the app. It covers the window (menus, toolbars, panels, status bar), documents, tabs, sheets, sets and revisions, every markup and measure tool, the Tool Chest, stamps, the Markups List, layers, compare, slip sheets, raceways, Dynamic Fill, batch operations, OCR, CAD import and export, printing, preferences and keyboard shortcuts. Each section says what a feature does and how to use it.

### [Architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md)

How the app is built. It describes the Tauri 2 shell, the SolidJS interface, and the PDF stack: PDFium in a separate worker process, PDF.js for text and structure, and pdf-lib for saving. It also covers the Rust crates for rendering, geometry and CAD, OCR, the MCP automation bridge, the page-coordinate model and the save/reopen contract, with a map of the repository.

### [File format](FILE-FORMAT.md)

What Oculith Draw writes into a PDF. Markups are standard PDF annotations with appearance streams, plus private `OPS_*` keys that let the app restore its own data. The page lists those keys on annotations, pages and the document catalog (custom columns, status sets, spaces, assemblies, layers), and explains what other PDF readers see.

### [Add-ons](ADDONS.md)

How optional local add-ons connect to the editor, what the host validates, and how to install or remove full edition and [independent packages](ADDON-PACKAGES.md).

### [Building from source](BUILDING.md)

How to build the app on Linux, Windows and macOS. It lists the tools and system libraries you need, the npm commands for a native build and a frontend-only build, the checks to run, the optional GEOS geometry feature, and where the build outputs go.

### [Credits](CREDITS.md)

The open-source projects Oculith Draw is built on. First among them is Open PDF Studio by the OpenAEC Foundation, the upstream editor. The page names each project, what it is used for and its licence, and points to the full notices that ship with the app.
