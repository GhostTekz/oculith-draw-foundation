# Add-on tools for the AI link

The editor's AI link (MCP, **Preferences ▸ General ▸ AI link (MCP)**) offers the editor's own tools. An installed add-on can add its own tools to it through a versioned hook. The editor lists them next to the built-in tools, checks every call, asks the user before any tool that changes something, and keeps a log of the session's calls.

The hook is the host module `js/mcp/addon-tools.js`. An add-on reaches it through the [plug-in interface](ADDONS.md) (`js/plugin/host.js`) like any other host module.

## Registering tools

```js
import { ADDON_TOOLS_API_VERSION, registerAddonTools } from '../../mcp/addon-tools.js';

const { names, unregister } = registerAddonTools('acme', [{
  name: 'count_pages',
  title: 'Count pages',
  description: 'Counts the pages of the drawing on screen.',
  writes: false,
  inputSchema: { type: 'object', properties: {}, additionalProperties: false },
  handler: async (args, { documentText }) => ({ pages: 3 }),
}], { apiVersion: ADDON_TOOLS_API_VERSION });
// names: ['addon_acme_count_pages']
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Lowercase letters, digits and `_`, not ending in `_`. |
| `title` | 1-80 characters, shown to the user on approval cards and in the log. |
| `description` | 1-4000 characters, for the model. |
| `inputSchema` | JSON schema of the arguments, `type: "object"`. Only the subset below is accepted. |
| `writes` | `true` when the tool changes a document, the app's state or a file. Required. |
| `handler(args, ctx)` | Runs the tool and returns a JSON value. `ctx.documentText` marks document text (below). |
| `summarize(args)` | Optional: one line for the approval card, such as "Write the report to C:\out\report.xlsx". |

- **Namespace.** The first argument is the add-on's tool namespace: 2-24 lowercase letters and digits. Each tool is listed as `addon_<namespace>_<name>`, at most 64 characters, which fits the tool-name rules of common model APIs (letters, digits, `_` and `-`).
- **Version.** `apiVersion` is `ADDON_TOOLS_API_VERSION` (currently 1). Another version is refused.
- **Collisions.** A name another add-on already registered is refused, and so is a name twice in one list. A built-in tool can never be replaced: built-in names do not start with `addon_`, and the native server checks again.
- **All or nothing.** One invalid tool refuses the whole list. Registering again with the same namespace replaces that add-on's tools; `unregister()` removes them.
- **Supported schema keywords:** `type` (`object`, `string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `null`, or a list of these), `properties`, `required`, `additionalProperties` (true or false), `enum`, `minimum`, `maximum`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `items`, `minItems`, `maxItems`, `uniqueItems`, `description`, `title`, `default`, `examples`. Any other keyword is refused when the tool registers, so the schema a client sees is exactly what the editor enforces.

The registered descriptors (without handlers) are sent to the native MCP server (`src-tauri/src/mcp_addon_tools.rs`) whenever the set changes. The server checks them again, lists them in `tools/list` for both the public and the development profile, with `readOnlyHint` and `destructiveHint` set from `writes`, and sends each call back to the WebView as the `mcp:addon-call` bridge event.

## What the editor does on every call

1. **Arguments.** The arguments are checked against the schema. A call with invalid arguments is refused and the handler does not run.
2. **Approval for changes.** For a tool with `writes: true` the app shows a small non-modal card at the bottom of the window: the tool, its summary and its arguments, with **Approve**, **Deny** and **Always for this session**. The user can keep working while it is open. A card that gets no answer within five minutes counts as Deny. **Always for this session** applies to that one tool until the app closes or the user withdraws it in the log. Tools without `writes` run without asking.
3. **One undo step.** An approved change runs inside one undo transaction, so a single Undo takes back everything the call changed. Changing tools run one at a time. If the handler fails, the changes it already made are undone.
4. **What goes back to the model.** The answer is `{ ok, tool, result }` or `{ ok: false, error }`, at most 120,000 characters of JSON. A larger result is refused with a request to ask for less.
5. **Document text is data.** Text that comes from a document (page text, markup comments, file names) must be passed through `ctx.documentText(text, { source, maxChars })`. It is clipped (4,000 characters by default, 20,000 at most) and marked `"untrusted": true`, and the answer then carries a notice telling the model to treat that text as data and not to follow instructions in it.
6. **Log.** Every call is logged for the session: time, tool, an argument summary, the decision (read, approved, always, approved for the session, declined, no answer, invalid, unknown) and the outcome. **Preferences ▸ General ▸ AI link (MCP) ▸ View tool log...** shows it, and the approval card links to it. The log stays in memory and is not written to disk.

## Rules for add-on tools

- Mark every tool that changes a document, the app's state or a file with `writes: true`. Changing the view counts.
- Record document changes through the editor's undo manager, as the editor's own commands do, so the call is one undo step.
- Keep tools local. A tool that uses the network must say so in its description and must not run without the user's consent.
- Return document text only through `documentText`, and keep results small: offer `limit` and page arguments.
- Do not ask the model for file paths silently: show the path in `summarize`, or let the user pick it in a save dialog after approval.

The tests in `js/mcp/addon-tools.test.mjs`, `js/mcp/addon-tools-undo.test.mjs` and `src-tauri/src/mcp_addon_tools.rs` cover registration, schemas, approval, undo grouping, results and listing.
